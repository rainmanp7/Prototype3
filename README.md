# HOLOLIFEX6 PROTOTYPE3

*A research framework exploring efficient synchronization in pulse-coupled entity networks*

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains experimental code for studying synchronization dynamics in networks of computational entities. Our research investigates interesting scaling patterns and efficiency characteristics that emerge from carefully designed pulse-coupled systems.

## üéØ Research Objectives

- **Study synchronization behavior** in computational entity networks
- **Analyze memory scaling patterns** across varying entity counts
- **Explore design variations** that influence computational efficiency
- **Document empirical observations** for future research directions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The framework implements several experimental approaches:

### Core Components
- **PulseCoupledEntity**: Base entity with phase synchronization dynamics
- **ScalableEntityNetwork**: Network management and coordination system
- **Lightweight4DSelector**: Efficient decision-making mechanism

### Experimental Variants
- **Constant-time scaling** with cluster-based optimization
- **Quantum superposition** entities with domain flexibility  
- **Holographic compression** for memory efficiency

## üìä Experimental Results

Our preliminary observations show interesting scaling characteristics:

### Memory Efficiency
- **16 entities**: ~33.3MB memory usage
- **1024 entities**: ~35.8MB memory usage  
- **Scaling efficiency**: 98.3% better than linear expectations

### Performance Characteristics
- Sub-linear memory growth with entity count
- Maintained synchronization across scale variations
- Consistent computational patterns across experiments

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
NumPy
psutil
```

### Basic Usage
```python
# Run safe scaling tests
python github_safe_testbed.py

# Explore experimental variants  
python holy_grail_experiments.py
```

### Example: Basic Entity Network
```python
from github_safe_testbed import PulseCoupledEntity, ScalableEntityNetwork, Lightweight4DSelector

# Initialize network
decision_model = Lightweight4DSelector(num_entities=16, dim=8)
network = ScalableEntityNetwork(decision_model)

# Add entities and observe synchronization
for i in range(16):
    entity = PulseCoupledEntity(f"ENT-{i}", "semantic")
    network.add_entity(entity)

# Run evolution steps
for cycle in range(100):
    insights = network.evolve_step(system_state)
```
