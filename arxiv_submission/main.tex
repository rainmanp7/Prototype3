\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We examine synchronization dynamics in networks of pulse-coupled computational entities and observe interesting scaling patterns. Our experiments show memory usage growing sub-linearly with entity count, with 1024 entities operating within 35.8MB of memory. We explore three architectural variations—cluster-based synchronization, domain-flexible entities, and compressed state representation—that maintain synchronization while demonstrating computational efficiency. These empirical observations may inform future work on distributed AI systems.

\section{Introduction}
Recent approaches to artificial intelligence scaling have predominantly focused on increasing model parameters, often accompanied by linear or super-linear computational costs. We investigate an alternative direction using synchronized networks of simple computational entities. While traditional distributed systems theory typically predicts linear memory scaling with component count, we observe patterns where carefully designed pulse-coupled networks can maintain synchronization while exhibiting sub-linear memory growth.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Entity Design}
Each computational entity implements phase synchronization dynamics inspired by Kuramoto oscillator models, combined with domain-specific behavioral patterns and local state vector maintenance. The base entity structure includes phase evolution and coupling mechanisms that enable network-wide synchronization.

\subsection{Architectural Variations}
We implement and compare three distinct architectural approaches:

\textbf{Cluster-based synchronization}: Entities are organized into clusters with representative nodes managing group coordination, reducing overall communication overhead while maintaining global synchronization.

\textbf{Domain-flexible operation}: Entities operate across multiple computational domains with superposition mechanics, allowing dynamic adaptation to different computational contexts.

\textbf{Compressed representation}: Network state information is maintained in reduced dimensions through linear compression techniques, enabling efficient scaling while preserving essential synchronization information.

\subsection{Experimental Framework}
Our testing framework executes incremental scaling tests from 16 to 1024 entities, monitoring memory usage, step computation time, and synchronization coherence at each scale. All experiments are designed to operate within practical computational constraints (7GB RAM limit).

\section{Empirical Observations}

\subsection{Scaling Patterns}
Our experimental results show memory usage growing from 33.3MB with 16 entities to 35.8MB with 1024 entities. This represents significantly sub-linear growth compared to theoretical linear expectations, which would predict approximately 2.1GB memory usage for 1024 entities based on the 16-entity baseline.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}
Across all experimental scales, we observe:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Synchronization coherence maintained above 0.70
    \item Step computation times under 0.3 milliseconds for 1024 entities
    \item Effective cross-domain operation and coordination
    \item Consistent behavioral patterns across architectural variations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Architectural Comparisons}
The three architectural variants demonstrate distinct characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cluster-based approach shows highest synchronization coherence (0.999)
    \item Domain-flexible entities exhibit interesting entropy dynamics
    \item Compressed representation maintains performance with reduced memory footprint
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
The observed sub-linear memory patterns present an interesting empirical finding that merits further theoretical investigation. While established distributed systems theory would typically predict linear scaling relationships, our results show different behavior under specific architectural conditions involving pulse-coupled synchronization and optimized state representation.

These findings suggest potential avenues for designing more computationally efficient distributed AI systems, particularly in scenarios requiring coordination across large numbers of simple computational units. The maintenance of synchronization quality alongside sub-linear resource growth represents a promising direction for resource-constrained AI applications.

\section{Conclusion}
We have presented empirical observations of scaling behavior in pulse-coupled computational entity networks. The sub-linear memory growth and maintained synchronization quality across entity counts represent findings that may interest the distributed systems and efficient AI research communities. The architectural patterns explored—cluster synchronization, domain flexibility, and state compression—provide concrete approaches that others may build upon.

Further research is needed to fully understand the theoretical foundations of these observed patterns and to explore their applications in practical AI systems. Independent verification of these results and mathematical analysis of the underlying synchronization dynamics would be valuable contributions.
