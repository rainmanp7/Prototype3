   - Title: "Efficient Synchronization in Pulse-Coupled Entity Networks"
   - Authors: Christopher Brown
   - Abstract: We examine synchronization dynamics in networks of pulse-coupled computational entities and observe interesting scaling patterns. Our experiments show memory usage growing sub-linearly with entity count, with 1024 entities operating within 35.8MB of memory. We explore three architectural variations—cluster-based synchronization, domain-flexible entities, and compressed state representation—that maintain synchronization while demonstrating computational efficiency. These empirical observations may inform future work on distributed AI systems.
